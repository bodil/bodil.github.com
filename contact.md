### Recruiters

Please don't contact me. I'm asking you politely now; I will not be polite if you disregard this and
contact me anyway.

### Others

If you have an informal request, I am most likely to respond on [Mastodon]({{ config.fedi }}).

If you want to raise an issue about one of my software projects, it is better to use
[Github](https://github.com/bodil), or try Mastodon if if you don't feel like creating an issue is
warranted.

If you're inquiring about a speaking engagement for your conference, I'm afraid I'm taking a break
from conference speaking for the foreseeable future.

Whatever you do, emailing me is probably going to be a waste of time. My inbox is an ADHD graveyard
where emails go to wait for their ultimate garbage collection. However, my ADHD quite likes
Mastodon.
